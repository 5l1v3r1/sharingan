Sharingan is a recon multitool for offensive security / bug bounty

This is very much a work in progress and I'm relatively new to offensive security in general so if you see something that can be improved please open an issue or PR with suggested changes.

## Cloning for development
Outside of your gopath
`git clone https://github.com/leobeosab/sharingan`

## Installing
`go get github.com/leobeosab/sharingan/cmd/sharingancli`

## Dependencies
*   NMap
*   Go

## Usage
#### Note
Order matters when it comes to flags it must be `sharingancli [globalflags] command [commandflags]` if this isn't a wanted feature I can change it but I like how clean it is

### DNS
DNS busts the target with a wordlist you provide 
`sharingancli --target target.com --dns-wordlist /path/to/wordlist/ dns`
![dns example gif](./dns_example.gif)

### NMap Scan
Brings up a list of hosts found in previous dns scan if no hosts are found it asks if you want to run it on the target itself
`sharingancli --target target.com scan`
