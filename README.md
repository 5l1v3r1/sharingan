Sharingan is a recon multitool for offensive security / bug bounty

This is very much a work in progress and I'm relatively new to offensive security in general so if you see something that can be improved please open an issue or PR with suggested changes.

## Cloning
`go get github.com/leobeosab/sharingan`

## Usage
sharingan --target target.com --dns-wordlist /path/to/wordlist/

word list cannot understand what ~/ means yet so have it search from root or a relative path. This will be fixed shortly
