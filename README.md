Sharingan is a recon multitool for offensive security / bug bounty

Currently the only working features are DNS bruteforcing and checking if the host is up using nmap

This is very much a work in progress and I'm relatively new to offensive security in general so if you see something that can be improved please open an issue or PR with suggested changes.
